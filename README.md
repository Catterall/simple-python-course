# Simple Python course.

### What is the aim of this repository?
The aim of this repository is to:
- Provide an introduction to this course and its contents.
- Provide a full syllabus of every topic that will eventually be covered by this course.
- Provide links to every single course page in the wiki here in the `readme.md` as they're created.

### What is this course?
This repository will eventually be made up of a series of Python-based wiki-pages, written by myself, detailing aspects of the language and how to use it. The more I work on this course, the more pages will exist. The greater goal of this course is to provide yet another source of media that can be easily digestable for those wishing to get into programming, Python or both.
